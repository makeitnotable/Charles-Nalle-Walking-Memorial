        "As the sun rose on the morning of April 27, 1860, and light spilled across the cobblestone streets of Troy, New York, Charles Nalle, a humble coachman in his thirties, was walking to George Holeur's Fashionable Bakery to pick up bread for his employers, the Gilberts. Charles wasn't a man of grandeur or heroic postures—just a man who carried the scars of his past silently, a past he'd escaped years before in Virginia. He had built a life here in Troy, far from the lash of Blucher Hansbrough, the man who once owned him.",
        "But freedom, as Charles would be reminded, is fragile.",
        "The aroma of fresh-baked bread filled the air as Charles neared the bakery's entrance. Suddenly, seemingly out of nowhere, the hands of slave catcher Henry J. Wale, who hunted freedom like a sport, seized and shackled him. Standing smugly beside him, United States Deputy Marshal Holmes shouted, \"Charles Nalle, I hereby arrest you in the name of the United States of America!\" Back home in Virginia, Charles's half-brother, Blucher Hansbrough—who had hired the slave catchers under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850—would have smiled with cruel satisfaction at the news of Charles's capture, relishing the thought of him being dragged back into slavery through streets he had walked as a free man.",

People shoved, then they through punches, and the two blocks between State and Congress Streets became a battlefield. From within the chaos, a bloodied Charles in shredded clothes emerged—torn free by the sweeping mob—broke into a sprint and started running.",

It was, after all, the central and defining characteristic of his life, even if it was not always obvious in his appearance.

Day by day, Charles began to fall into the life of Troy, building an unassuming reputation known secretly by those who mattered. With time, his hands and the unspoken history written in their lines mastered the navigation of Gilbert's carriages across cobbled streets, and his presence became familiar enough to seem invisible. But even in the most peaceful of places, the shadows of the past can cast themselves.",

Unbeknownst to him, the fields of Culpeper County, Virginia, were closer to Charles than he could imagine.

By now, the trail of churning water had disappeared with the ferry. Charles hurled himself into the cold embrace of the dark and forbidding Hudson.
