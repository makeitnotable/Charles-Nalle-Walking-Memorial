        "In 1821, Charles Nalle was born into slavery in Stevensburg, Virginia. Charles' father was Peter Hansbrough, a wealthy plantation owner, and his mother was Lucy, a slave and property to Hansbrough. Charles had a brother, Blucher, son of Peter and Frances (Peter's Wife); they were raised together and resembled each other. In Charles's early 20's, he was married to Catherine \"Kitty\" Simms, who lived on the Berry Hill Plantation in Halifax County, Virginia. In time, she bore five children. In 1855, Kitty and her children were freed upon the death of her owner. Virginia, at the time, required freed slaves to leave the state. This led Kitty, her children, and her sister to move to Washington, DC where freed slaves could live.",
        "Charles eventually escaped with a fellow slave, Jim Banks, and made his way to Troy, NY. With a strong background in coachmanship, Charles became the carriage driver for Uri Gilbert, one of Troy's wealthiest individuals who made his fortune building carriages. In April of 1860, Charles Nalle was arrested under the Fugitive Slave Act before entering the George Holeur's Fashionable Bakery while running an errand for the Gilberts.",
        "On the day of his capture, Charles was taken and held in Troy to be returned to Virginia and that's when the the community of Troy worked together to raise $1000 to purchase Charles' freedom. Charles Nalle, now a free man, returned to Troy on his way to Washington, DC in 1867 to be reunited with his wife and children."

The paintings are a part of a series \"A Fugitive Slave Rescued: Paintings of Charles Nalle\" completed between the years of 2008 and 2015. A selection of the paintings were showcased in Troy during the 150th anniversary of the historic rescue in partnership with Scott Christanson in Troy in 2010. The series was a part of Priest's larger project depicting the history of the Underground Railroad for which he worked alongside his wife, Licia Priest."
